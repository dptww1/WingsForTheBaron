* Development 

** Users
*** Cucumber test file

** Games
*** creating a game gets doubled "Game was successfully created" messages
*** handle bad user ids
*** convert text boxes to dropdowns, with "Me" option
*** handle bad user names
*** handle bad side_names
*** implement inflation
*** implement morale penalty for lagging technology
*** implement game termination conditions
*** execute_war_status_card should save game state (I think)
*** initial contracts_available should depend on number of players

* Production
** config/environments/development.rb: config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => "whatever" }
